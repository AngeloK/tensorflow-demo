### 2.1 Linear Regression Using TensorFlow

Linear regression is one of simplest machine learning algorithms. The aim of it is to find a linear model that could best fit the given dataset.

#### 2.1.1 Create Data

```
# The number of points 
num_points = 1000
vectors_set = []
for i in xrange(num_points):
	# using numpy to create random points.
    x1 = np.random.normal(0.0, 0.55)
    y1 = x1 * 0.1 + 0.3 + np.random.normal(0.0, 0.03)
    vectors_set.append([x1, y1])
```

#### 2.1.2 Fit Data

```
w = tf.Variable(tf.constant(value=1.0))
b = tf.Variable(tf.constant(value=0.0))
```
These 2 lines create 2 parameters used for our linear model such that:

								y = Wx + b

Then we define loss function(aks cost function) as:

							h = mean(square(y - y_data))
							
By minimizing the cost function, we are able to find the optimal parameter w and b.

```
# Loss function
sse = tf.reduce_mean(tf.pow(tf.sub(y_, y_data), 2))

# We use gradient descent with learning rate equals to 0.5.
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(sse)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
sess.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())

for i in range(1000):
    sess.run(train_step)
```
Pay attention here, in each tensorflow program, we have to create a session and run the data flow graph within the session. 

After running gradient descent 1000 times. we've got the optiaml w and b, which are [0.298826, 0.100289]

Then it't easy to plot a line on the top of the graph we created before. It is shown as follow:

By using tensorflow, linear regression could be easily implemented without writing too much code and importing scitific modules. And it's faster with high accuracy. 

### 3.1 Convolutional Neural Networks

#### 3.1.1 Introduction of CNN

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)[[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) are biologically-inspired variants of MLPs and they have wide applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing. Differed from normal feedforward neural networks (aks fully connected neural networks), CNNs consider more about small sub-regions of the virtual field, that's why they have better performance on image recognition. In implementation part, we used [The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/).
